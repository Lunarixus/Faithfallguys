# Faithfallguys

# What is this?
Faithfallguys is an external hack for the Fall Guys game made by Mediatonic.  
I wrote this as a proof of concept for people to learn about how the Fall Guys game works  
and/or learn how to write hacks for other similar Unity games.

# How to use
There are precompiled binaries inside of the "Debug" folder, open the game and run the hack to use it.  

# How to compile
Use Visual Studio 2019 or higher and build for x64 (building for x86 breaks offset calculation).

# Will this get me banned?
Most likely yes, this isn't meant to be some sophisticated hack, it's meant for showing the  
Fall Guys developers what we can do and give them better ideas on how to patch it.  

# This hack doesn't work!
This is most likely because it's either been patched or I haven't updated the offsets.
